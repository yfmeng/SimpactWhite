Basics
------

Run the following command line first:
	source ./runme-first.sh
or
	. ./runme-first.sh
(the . at the start of the line is a short-hand notation for 'source', and
must not be omitted)

This is to make sure that the programs will also search inside the 'libs' subdirectory
for needed components (things that are not present on a default OS X installation)

Then, to start a program, for example run:
	./simpact-cyan-opt-debug config.txt 1

To send all output to a file do
	./simpact-cyan-opt-debug config.txt 1 >output_file 2>&1

To run with a specific random number generator seed (for testing), you can run
	MNRM_DEBUG_SEED=12345 ./simpact-cyan-opt-debug config.txt 1 

Configuration tool
------------------

To create config files based on a config file with defaults and a CSV file with
changes, use for example:
	./configtool.py config.txt sample_input_spec.csv modified_config_

To specify in the CSV file that you'd like to keep the default value for a setting,
enter '*' at that location.
